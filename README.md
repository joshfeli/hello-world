# SEO Tech Developer Program: Week 1 Project: Playlist Display
![PEP8 Style Checker](https://github.com/joshfeli/hello-world/actions/workflows/first-workflow.yaml/badge.svg?event=push)

## At a Glance
This project practices working with an API by grabbing the songs from one of my YouTube Music playlists and storing them in a database. In doing so, this project practices the skills of:
- Retrieving data from an API,
- Storing the data in a database
- Writing code that follows the PEP8 style guidelines,
- Using a Github workflow as a CI/CD tool,
- Writing unit tests
- Formatting clear documentation with README files.

## Setup
Requires installation of the `python-youtube`, `SQLAlchemy`, and `pandas` libraries. To install all three of these libraries at once, enter into your terminal:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or, on Linux distributions,
```
$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```
