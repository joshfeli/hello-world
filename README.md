SEO Tech Developer Program: Week 1 Project
This project practices the skill of using real-world APIs and processing the JSON data returned as responses from the server. Requires installation of the `python-youtube` library:

```
$ pip install python-youtube
```
OR, on Linux distributions:
```
$ sudo pip install python-youtube
```
You can use this library by writing the statement `import pyyoutube` at the top of your files.
